1.    Given   the   following   scenario   analysis   for   stocks   X   and   Y,
                                                            Bear   Market                       Normal   Market                    Bull   MarketProbability 0.2 0.5 0.3 Stock X -20% 18% 50% Stock Y -15% 20% 10% 
(a)   What   are   the   expected   rates   of return   for   Stocks   X   and   Y?
(b)   What   are   the   standard   deviations   of returns   on   Stocks   X   and   Y?
(c)   What   is   the   expected   return   and   standard   deviation   of   a   portfolio   with   weight   0.8   in   Stock   X and   0.2   in   Stock   Y.
2.   You   can   invest   in   a   risky   asset   with   an   expected   rate   of return   of   20%   per   year   and   a   standard   deviation   of 40%   per   year   or   a   risk   free   asset   earning   5%   per   year   or   a   combination   of the   two.   The   borrowing   rate   is   6%   per   year.(a)   Draw   the   Capital   Allocation   Line.   Indicate   the   points   corresponding   to   (1)   50%   in   the   risk-less   asset   and   50%   in   the   risky   asset;   and   (2)   -50%   in   the   riskless   asset   and   150%   in   the   risky   asset.
(b)    Compute   the   expected   rate   of   return   and   standard   deviation   for   the   two   portfolios   in   part   (a).
(c)    Suppose   you   have   a   target   risk   level   of   50%   per   year.    How   would   you   construct   a   portfolio   of   the   risky   and   the   riskless   asset   to   attain   this   target   level   of   risk?   What   is   the   expected   rate   of   return   of   the   portfolio   you   constructed?
3.   An   investor   is   considering   3   ETFs:   a   stock   fund,   a   bond   fund,   and   T-bill   fund.   The   T-bill   fund   yields   a   risk-free   rate   of   4%.   The   probability   distribution   of   the   risky   funds   are:Expected Ret Std Dev Stock                                                               13% Bond                                                                                                 8% Correlation = 0.3 20% 12% 
(a)   What   is   the   mean-variance   efficient   mix   of stocks   and   bonds?   What   is   the   expected   return   and   std   of   the   MVE?
(b)    Suppose   the   investor   has   mean   variance   preferences   with   a   coefficient   of   risk   aversion   of   γ   =   4,   what   would   be   the   optimal   weights   in   risk-free   asset   and   the   mve?
(c)   In   the   optimal   complete   portfolio,   what   are   the   optimal   weights   in   each   of these   three   funds?
(d)    Suppose that the investors has financial wealth W   =   $1,   000,   000   and riskless   human   capital   with   a   present   value   of   H   =   $500,   000.   How   should   the   investor   allocate   her   financial   wealth   to   each   of   the   three   funds   in   order   to   achieve   the   desired   weights   of   her   total   wealth   you   calculated   in  代 写FIN 532: Investments Final Exam Practice Problems Fall 2024Web

(e)    Suppose   that   the   investor   takes   your   advice   in   part    (d).      Over   the   next   year,   the   stock   fund   appreciates   by   20%,   the   bond   fund   appreciates   by   10%   and   the   present   value   of   H   decreases   to   $400,000.   Explain   how   the   investor   should   rebalance   her   portfolio?
CAPM 
1.   You   have   the   following   information   about   hedge   fund   Q   and   the   market   portfolio   M.Stock Q Market Portfolio (M) Expected return Standard deviation ? 40% 10% 20% 
The   correlation   between   fund   Q   and   the   market   portfolio   is   ρQ,M      =   0.6.    The   risk-free   rate   is 3%.   For   parts   (a)-(c)   of this   question,   you   should   assume   that   the   CAPM   holds.
(a)   What   is   the   beta   of   fund   Q?   What   is   the   expected   return   of   fund   Q   according   to   the   CAPM?
(b)    Suppose   you   decide   to   invest   in   a   portfolio   that   consists   of   20%   in   Q,   50%   in   the   market   portfolio,   and   30%   in   the   risk-free   asset.   What   is   the   Sharpe   ratio   of this   portfolio?
(c)   Instead   of   holding   the   portfolio   described   in   part   (b),   you   decide   to   find   a   portfolio   with the   same expected return   as the portfolio   in   part   (b)   but   with   the   lowest   possible   standard deviation.   What   are   the   optimal   portfolio   weights   in   Q,   M,   and   the   risk-free   asset?   What is   the   Sharpe   ratio   of   this   portfolio?
Now   suppose   that   the   CAPM   does   not   hold   and   fund   Q   has   a   positive   α   = 2.5%.
(d)      Compute   the   MVE   mix   of   Q   and   M.
(e)   What   is   the   α   of   fund   Q   with   respect   to   the   MVE   mix   you   calculated   in   part   (d).
(e)    If other investors can also easily   identify   fund   Q   as   having   positive   α,   would   you   expect   the   positive   α   to   persist?   Explain   why   or   why   not?
2.    Consider   the   following   properties   of   the   returns   of   stock    1,    stock   2,   and   of   the   market    (m):   σ   1      =   0.20,   σ2    = 0.30,   σm    = 0.15,   ρ   1m      = 0.4,   ρ2m      = 0.7   and   E[rm]   =   0.10.    Also,   suppose   that   the risk-free   rate   rf      =   0.05.
(a)   According   to   the   Capital   Asset   Pricing   Model,   what   should   be   the   expected   return   of   stock 1   and   of   stock   2? 
(b)    Suppose that   the   correlation   between   the   return   of stock   1   and the   return   of stock   2   is   0.5.   What   is the   expected   return   of a   portfolio that   has   a   40%   investment   in   stock   1   and   a   60%   investment   in   stock   2?
(c)   Assume   the   CAPM   holds.      Construct   a   new   portfolio   using   the   market   portfolio   and   the   risk-free   asset   that   has   the   same   expected   return   as   the   portfolio   you   considered   in   part   b)   but   has   the   lowest   standard   deviation   possible.
